                            <h1>Introduction</h1>
							<p>Joseph Addison (1672-1719) was a Fellow of Magdalen College after studying classics at Queen's College, Oxford. He held a number of government positions during his life, but is arguably best remembered for co-founding the daily The Spectator with Richard Steele.</p>

							<p>Cato by Addison, a drama about the Roman statesman and stoic Cato's resistance to Czar, was a huge hit, and George Washington had it played for his troops at Valley Forge. </p>

							<p>Addison's enduring impact on English literature can be attributed to his hopeful writing style, which is laced with courteous mannerisms. </p>

                            <h1>Author’s Works</h1>
							<p>Addison invented an essay type in his and Richard Steele's The Spectator, which affected eighteenth-century journals immensely. Addison clearly acknowledges some first hints towards an aesthetics theory in the brief well-known sections on the joys of the imagination in our readings. </p>

							<p>Addison's articles appealed to the emerging middle class trying to better their refinement and taste because his contribution indicates a change in emphasis from the artist's works to the joys of the connoisseur. Only the later pleasures come from sight, according to Addison. Whether mental pleasures are derived from the sight or concepts of visible objects, he believes the pleasure is derived from their expansiveness, freshness, or beauty. </p>

							<p>He claims that the Supreme Being, who provides light and color to the world, is responsible for such joy. He claims that the Supreme Being, who provides light and color for us to see His handiwork, is the source of such pleasure. As a result, Addison feels that the beauty of nature outweighs the beauty of art, despite the fact that distinct qualities of beauty in each form complement the beauty of the other. </p>

                            <h1>Essays on The Pleasures of Imagination</h1>
							<p>The Pleasures of the Imagination, a collection of articles by Joseph Addison published in The Spectator Nos. 411–421 in 1712, is often considered to be the first representation of current aesthetic experience. It's not a book, a philosophical endeavor, or a theoretical ‘system.' From a philosophical viewpoint, it's rather varied. Due to the essay's genre, Addison was able to absorb and bring together many of the discourses and notions that were significant in the establishment of modern aesthetics in the early eighteenth century. In comparison to a philosophical treatise, an essay has the advantage of being able to transmit a greater number of ideas, connections, and recollections.</p>

							<p>This triadic division of qualifications or principles (as Addison does not consistently refer to them) encompasses 'all' of the possible types of 'aesthetic' experience; however, we rarely encounter them in their pure forms; instead, we frequently encounter some combination of them, while it is also true that the effect is strengthened rather than weakened by their combination.</p>

							<p>The Addisonian 'greatness' (or ‘grandeur') and 'beauty' would be theorized as the two major aesthetic categories of the Sublime and the Beautiful during the eighteenth century, while the 'uncommon' would partly inspire the picturesque by the end of the century, and partly dissolve into the other two qualities in Edmund Burke already in the middle of the century.</p>

							<h2>Summary of Essay 411: Types of Pleasure</h2>
							<p>For Addison sight is the most complete sense of all our senses, and it is this sense that provides ideas to Imagination. Every image, he believes, enters our Fancy for the first time through sight. The images we see via our eyes may then be saved and transformed into a wide range of pictures that appeal to our imagination. According to Locke, this competent ability of the mind allows one to be pleased by vistas and landscapes more lovely than any other in nature.</p>
                            
							<p>For Addison, the Joys of Imagination are pleasures that arise from seeing something. He distinguishes between two types of pleasures: Primary Pleasures are derived from objects as they are; Secondary Pleasures are derived from objects that are not in front of our eyes but are remembered or even created based on hypothetical images of reality.
                            The second type of pleasure is more desirable since it is evidence of the mind's fresh invention and progress. The joys of imagination are simpler to get than the pleasures of knowing. It only takes opening one’s eye to set the scene. To withdraw safely within this realm of harmless pleasures and find just happiness in them, one must expand this imagination.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>The joys of fancy lead to considerably better health than the pleasures of knowledge, which are worked out by thinking and are a mental labor. Beautiful natural sights, poetry, and painting have a soothing effect on the body; they not only cleanse the mind but also aid to dispel sadness. As a result, Francis Bacon, for example, recommends to his readers various studies that would fill the mind with wonderful items such as history, tales, and natural contemplation.</p>

							<h2>Longinus’ Influence on Addison’s The Pleasures of Imagination</h2>
							<p>Pseudo-Longinus, or simply Longinus as he was known at the time, was one of Addison's favorite ancient authors. In the early twentieth century translation of A. O. Prickard, we may read the following in section xxxv of his fragmentary Greek text of Peri Hypsous</p>
                            
							<p>The Addisonian 'aesthetic' trio appears to be a perfect and patent antitype of this. Our soul's thirst for the 'greater' and 'more divine' reveals itself immediately (anachronistically speaking: 'aesthetically') in our innate preference for 'the remarkable, the magnificent, and the beautiful’.
                            Longinus' work had been a rhetorical and poetical treatise that exhibited and explained the phenomenon of the 'sublime' through several literary examples until this section, but now the author shifts gears and begins to speak about the human soul, our destination, and the perception of certain natural objects.
                            It appears that Addison began The Pleasures of the Imagination with this point in Longinus, and only went to architecture and, primarily, literature in the second part of his essay-series. He defines grandeur, outlines common sources of natural sublimity, and explains how the aesthetic response to sublimity is triggered psychologically
                            </p>
                            <p>Addison makes numerous observations here that have remained essential in subsequent literature on the sublime. First, he claims that the sublime necessitates a unified majesty in some way. Second, he identifies the regular mountain ranges, deserts, and oceans as the most majestic elements of nature. Finally, he describes the sublime reaction or effect as a pleasure brought on by seeking to fill the mind with a "too huge" item. Johnson, Gerard, and Burke, among others, examine the sublime impact in comparable but frequently more extensive ways.</p>
